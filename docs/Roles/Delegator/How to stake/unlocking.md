# Step 3
**Calculating early unlock penalty**

If you choose to unlock your LEMX before the assigned lockup period, you have this option. However, you will incur a penalty equal to half the rewards accrued. You can read more about this [here](/docs/Roles/Delegator/specifications#locking).

Prior to proceeding with the token unlock, it's necessary to calculate any applicable penalty.

1. Enter the quantity of LEMX you wish to unlock in the "Amount" field.
2. Click "Calculate Penalty".

In the case you decide to unlock in the same epoch you locked your LEMX, you will incur no penalty on your rewards.

1. Enter the quantity of LEMX you wish to unlock in the "Amount" field.
2. Click "Unlock".
