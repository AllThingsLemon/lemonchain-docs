# Step 3
**Choosing your validator**

:::danger Keep in mind

We strongly recommend careful selection of your validator, taking into account their uptime, industry experience, and community engagement, as these elements are crucial in influencing your decision. 

Additionally, be aware that if a validator acts inappropriately and faces penalties (slashed), their entire stake, including yours, will be lost. You can read more about this [here](/docs/Roles/Validator/specifications#slashing).

:::

On the staking dashboard, each validator displays the maximum lock-up time for your LEMX, their total stake (minimum of 350,000 LEMX plus delegations), and available space (15 times the total stake).

2. Click "Stake" and confirm the transaction to complete the process.

**LEMX is staked**

Congratulations! Your LEMX is now staked. At any time, you can visit the staking dashboard, and view your delegations as pointed in the red arrow below. If you have staked to multiple different validators, your delegations to them will be displayed here as well.
