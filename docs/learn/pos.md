# Proof of Stake

Proof of stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism designed to safeguard against Sybil attacks, where a user tries to take over the network with multiple false identities.  In proof-of-stake, validators are randomly selected to add blocks to the chain based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold. This means that validators do not need to compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, as they do in proof-of-work (PoW) systems.

### Here is a simplified overview of how PoS works:

1. Nodes on the network stake their cryptocurrency.
2. Validators are randomly selected to add blocks to the chain.
3. The validators verify the transactions in the block and add it to the chain.
4. The validators are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their work.

The amount of cryptocurrency that a node stakes determines the probability that it will be selected as a validator. So, if you want to increase your chances of becoming a validator, you need to stake more cryptocurrency.

Here is a table comparing PoS and PoW:

| Feature                     | Proof of Stake                                                    | Proof of Work                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How validators are selected | Randomly selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold | Based on who can solve the most complex mathematical puzzle first |
| Energy efficiency           | Much more energy-efficient                                        | Very energy-intensive                                             |
| Environmental friendliness  | More environmentally friendly                                     | Less environmentally friendly                                     |
| Decentralization            | Less decentralized                                                | More decentralized                                                |
| Security                    | Not as secure as PoW                                              | More secure than PoS                                              |

### Here are some additional details about how PoS works:

**Staking:** When a user stakes their cryptocurrency, they are essentially lending it to the network to help secure it. In return, they are rewarded with a portion of the transaction fees that are processed on the network. The amount of rewards that a user receives depends on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake and the length of time they stake it for.

**Slashing:** If a validator behaves maliciously, such as by trying to double-spend or by failing to verify transactions, they may be slashed. Slashing means that the validator's staked cryptocurrency is penalized. You can read more about slashing [here](/docs/Roles/Validator/specifications#slashing).

PoS is a relatively new consensus mechanism, but it is gaining popularity as a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to PoW. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies that use PoS include Cardano, Solana, and recently, Ethereum.
