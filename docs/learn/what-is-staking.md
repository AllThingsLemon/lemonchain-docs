# What is Staking?

Staking refers to the process of participating in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network by holding and **locking up a network's native tokens** in a digital wallet to support network operations such as transaction validation, security, and governance. In return for staking their tokens, participants receive rewards, often in the form of additional tokens, proportional to their stake.
